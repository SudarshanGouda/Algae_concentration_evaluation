The first consists of data for 200 water samples. To be more precise, each observation in the games of available data is in fact an aggregation of several water samples taken from the same river over a period of 3 months, during the same season of the year.

Each observation contains information on 11 variables. Three of these variables are nominal and describe the season of the year when the water samples to be aggregated were taken, as well as the size and speed of the river in question. The remaining eight variables are values of different chemical parameters measured in the water samples forming aggregation.
